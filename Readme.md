This repository contains a basic implementation of a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. The API supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a specific resource.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)

API Endpoints:
1. Create a new resource
Endpoint: /api/resource
Method: POST
Request Body: JSON object representing the new resource
Response: JSON object representing the newly created resource
2. Get all resources
Endpoint: /api/resource
Method: GET
Response: JSON array containing all the resources
3. Get a specific resource
Endpoint: /api/resource/:id
Method: GET
Parameters:
id: The unique identifier of the resource
Response: JSON object representing the resource with the specified ID
4. Update a specific resource
Endpoint: /api/resource/:id
Method: PUT
Parameters:
id: The unique identifier of the resource
Request Body: JSON object representing the updated resource
Response: JSON object representing the updated resource
5. Delete a specific resource
Endpoint: /api/resource/:id
Method: DELETE
Parameters:
id: The unique identifier of the resource
Response: JSON object indicating the success of the delete operation
Database
This project uses an in-memory array as the database for simplicity. If you want to use a persistent database, you can modify the code accordingly (e.g., using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Error Handling
The API handles common errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in the response. Examples include resource not found, validation errors, and server errors.

Testing the API
You can use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints locally.
